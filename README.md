# Chrome Browser Extensions

This repo contains a presentation built with [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) to give an overview of what a Chrome extension is, and how to build one.

To install it run `yarn install`.

To present run `yarn start`.

## Boilerplate

There is also a [Chrome Extension Template repo](https://github.com/edrpls/chrome-extension-template) that you can use as a starting point to build Chrome Extensions.

[Here is a sample Chrome Extension built with the template](https://github.com/edrpls/social-network-alert).
